# Retrieve-original-recordings-usind-ICA

Independent component analysis (ICA) assumes that the features are mixtures of independent sources, and it tries to isolate these independent sources from the mixture.

In this simple project, We are going to look at an example with three different sources of sound: piano, cello, and TV. Using ICA, we will separate the three sources from recordings that have a mixture of the sources.

 **Note**, it's important to know the assumptions that allow ICA to work.
- It assumes that the components are statistically independent
- It assumes that the components must have non-Gaussian distribution.

**This project from what I learned from Udacity**
